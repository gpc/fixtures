The "build-test-data plugin":http://www.grails.org/plugin/build-test-data is a great plugin that simplifies specifying test data by populating required properties for you that you don't care about in your particular test.

Consider the following class...

{code}
// Book.groovy
class Book {
  String title
  String isbn

  static constraints = {
    title(required: true)
    isbn(required: true)
  }
}
{code}

Whenever an instance of Book is created for a test, the @isbn@ property has to be populated for the object to pass validation which can be distracting if your test does not care about the @isbn@ property. The build-test-data plugin provides a static @build()@ method on all domain classes that creates an instance with all non-specified, mandatory properties filled in with placeholder values that pass constrain tests. For more information, see the documentation on the plugin.

The fixtures plugin integrates with build-test-data by providing a @build()@ method that has the same behaviour as @load()@ except that objects are created via the build-test-data static @build()@ method.

Which means that the following test will pass...

{code}
def fixture = fixtureLoader.build {
  gina(Book, title: "Groovy In Action")
}
assert fixture.gina.isbn != null
{code}

And is equivalent to...

{code}
def gina = Book.build(title: "Groovy In Action")
assert gina.isbn != null
{code}

In fixture files, you can specify that build-test-data integration should be used by using the @build()@ method instead of the usual @fixture()@ method.

h4. Switching it on/off

You may only want to define part of your fixture with build-test-data integration, or conversely you may want to define part of it without it. You can do this via the @build()@ and @noBuild()@ methods inside a fixture definition.

{code}
fixtureLoader.load {
  build {
    gina(Book, title: "Groovy In Action")
  }
}
{code}

{code}
fixtureLoader.build {
  noBuild {
    gina(Book, title: "Groovy In Action", isbn: "12345678")
  }
}
{code}

h4. Installing build-test-data

Note that build-test-data integration only works if you have installed the build-test-data plugin yourself. The fixtures plugin does not attempt to install it for you.
